# HumHub-Sponsor

## What does it to?

This module tracks which members invited others to register at your web site.

This is useful if you have set up your HumHub web site to only allow people to register by invitation. The module tracks the invitations and subsequent registrations. 

The recorded information is not editable, but can be queried to trace how certain people came to be part of your online community. This may be useful if a member is causing problems and some action needs to be taken to prevent re-occurance.

Note: This module can only maintain its records while it is installed and enabled - HumHub itself does not record this information. There is no point installing this module after problems are being reported by your community.
